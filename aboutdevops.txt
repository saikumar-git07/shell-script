DevOps is a software development and IT operations approach that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. A DevOps culture unites traditionally separate teams, like development, IT operations, and quality assurance, to work together across the entire application lifecycle. This cultural and technical shift results in numerous business and operational benefits. 
Key principles and practices of DevOps
Continuous integration (CI): Developers merge code changes frequently into a central repository, where automated builds and tests are run to ensure code is functional and stable. This identifies issues early and reduces the risk of conflicts.
Continuous delivery and continuous deployment (CD): After testing, code is automatically deployed to a testing environment (continuous delivery) or directly to production (continuous deployment). This automates the release process and enables faster delivery of new features and updates.
Automation: Automating repetitive tasks throughout the software lifecycle, such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning, reduces manual effort and human error.
